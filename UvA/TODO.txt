CALIBRATION FISHEYE
*change the template parameters in param.xml to fit sitting and standing 
*change the prior as smaller region 
change the resolution of the frame in RH
change the scale in param.xml in RH
improve the camera calibration -> contact geovision

*install yaml-cpp on Robot House computer 
*changes param.xml there 
record some videos in the Kitchen
calibrate the kinect in the living room
change with Mick if the care-o-bot get problems

-check frame.dat if it is correct 
reviewers standing in safe zone -> send to UH


= BAS =
* speed vector for tracked people, for use to determine orientation
* report responsibilities for scenerio year 2 in the google doc
- good tracker (appearance info, temporal method, remember people that disappeared)
- detect people using overlapping cameras in a single process
- multi-threaded detection
- dynamic background model adopts new frame as model when larger (light) change was detected
- proper install script for dependencies
- when assuming a small number of people, reuse the ID on new detections
- tracking in kitchen using kinect?
- launch file that visualizes the detection and background model?


= TEST EVERTHING =
update git in the Robot House 
rosmake

robot detected as human 

= DEMO NOTES =
keeps curtains close, make sure lighting condition are stable
not moving around objects
reviewers stay in restricted zone
