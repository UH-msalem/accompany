3.To test this package, you need access to robot house mysql database. You can easilly set this up on your local machine. 
  The package is currently set to look for the database on the local machine i.e. #define DBHOST "tcp://localhost:3306"
  If the database is not on your local machine, you need to redefine DBHOST in ContextAwarePlanner.cpp with the new host 
  machine's ip/hostname and recompile the package.
	
   i.e. set #define DBHOST "tcp://NewMachineIP:3306"
  	or 
  	 	set #define DBHOST "tcp://NewMachineHostname:3306"
