Import the Database dump (maybe you can just import the new tables and then add the new sequences).

COBScheduler configuration:
import the package in your ros workspace and run it with "rosrun COBScheduler COBScheduler"

Web Services configuration:
- edit the config file (path: "AccompanyDatabaseWS/db_cnf") inserting the correct parameters for your database configuration
- open a terminal window and type:
  python WSname hostIP:hostPort   e.g: "python DatabaseConnectorWS.py 10.0.1.5:9995"

ImagesRepublisher:
-  It is a ros package, from terminal type: "rosrun AccompanyImagesRepublisher ImagesRepublisher"
-  It's possible to configure some parameters editing "AccompanyImagesRepublisher/config/config.txt" 

EmphasisServer (Squeeze-me):
- roslaunch AccompanyService AccompanyGUIService.launch (I've removed the other nodes. Now it runs only the emphasis server)

The GUI:
- just upload the apk on your tablet and edit the ros master ip, and the other values in the settings:
    - In the Database IP you should set the IP you passed to the Web Services (I assumed they are both on the same IP)
    - The database port is the port you passed to the DatabaseConnectorWS
    - The Robot status port is the one you passed to RobotStatusControlWS

To let the GUI work the Emphasis server should be running. The GUI can start without the ImagesRepublisher and the COBScheduler, but in that case
you will not have the images from the robot, or you'll not be able to run any Action.
