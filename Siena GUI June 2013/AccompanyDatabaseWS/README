This folder contains the two WS for the database connection and the control of the current task the robot is running.
The database WS is quite simple and consists just in an inteface between the android app and the mysql db.
The other one let the GUI know when the scheduler starts/finish any task which is different from sleep.
As we decided in February this mainly consist in an open http request from the GUI which is answerd only when there is a change
in the running task.
In this .py file I start (and close) also two threads. One is to monitor and upgrade the likelihood of action possibilities (It's 
actually empty I still need to fill it, I'll do in the future). The second one manages the expressions of the GUI.
