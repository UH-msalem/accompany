This node provides a new image transport with images resized to fit exactly the tablet screen dimension. 
It subscribe the images from an input topic that can be configured (from config file  "config/config.txt" )
and republish it in the new image transport (The output topic can be configured, but in that case I'll had 
to change the GUI code so please don't touch it).
Hence, it performs a sort of "downsampling" publishing only one images every n subscribed.
Finally it turn the image based on the last head position. To do that I subscribed the head_contoller/command topic
because it works in simulation. On the real robot you could have problems (I remember that there were sone issues with the head control
which worked on the same topic), in that case you can configure a new head control topic to be subscribed. However I expect this trick to work
only in case that the command messages are in the same format of head_controler/command. Otherwise (or if you have any other problem with the real robot)
 please let me know and I'll upgrade the code with the correct topic and messages format.
